Thoughts lead to the manifestation of all things and events in creation. Thoughts create our state of existence and the quality of our experience here on Earth. Therefore, be responsible for everything you create, by being responsible for everything you think."},{id:2,title:"Correspondence",slug:"correspondence",subTitle:"As above, so below.",desc:"That which is above is like to that which is below, that which is below is like to that which is above. The macrocosm (the totality) and the microcosm (the individual units of consciousness which comprise the whole) are reflections of one another. The universe is self-similar across all scales."},{id:3,title:"Vibration",slug:"vibration",subTitle:"Nothing is stationary.",desc:"Nothing rests, everything moves. At the most fundamental level, the universe and everything that comprises it, is pure vibratory energy manifesting itself in different ways. The universe has no solidity as such; the universe is holographic. Matter is merely energy in a state of vibration."},{id:4,title:"Polarity",slug:"polarity",subTitle:"Everything has its polar opposite.",desc:"Everything is dual, everything has poles. Everything has its opposite. Opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree (e.g. hot and cold are seemingly opposites, while all that cold truly is, is the absence of heat energy). At some level of reality, all things that seems contradictory may be reconciled."},{id:5,title:"Rhythm",slug:"rhythm",subTitle:"All is ebb and flow.",desc:"Everything flows; out and in, in and out. Everything has its tides. All things rise and fall. The pendulum swing manifests in everything. The measure of the swing to the right, is the measure of the swing to the left. Rhythm compensates."},{id:6,title:"Causality",slug:"causality",subTitle:"Cause and effect.",desc:"Every cause has its effect, and every effect has its cause. Everything happens according to law. Chance is but a name for law not recognised. There are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes law. There is no free will to ignore law without consequence; that is the limit of free will. This is why natural law is also sometimes referred to as consequentialism."},{id:7,title:"Gender",slug:"gender",subTitle:"Everything has its male and female properties.",desc:"Gender is in everything, everything has its masculine and feminine properties; gender manifests on all planes. While every person has a biological sex, psychologically both qualities exist simultaneously within everyone, and everything."},{id:8,title:"Care",slug:"care",subTitle:"The lost principle",desc:"Care (not compassion) is whatever you give attention to, and help to grow. The lost principle is the dynamic of care; that which you actually care enough about to do, to spend your time on, to pay attention to, and to manifest into reality. What we care about on a day-to-day basis acts as the driving force of our thoughts and actions."}]),k=""+globalThis.__publicAssetsURL("img/market/tfm-notebook-angle-left-white.webp"),_={class:"container mx-auto"},T=u('<section class="relative grid grid-cols-6 mx-4 border-t pt-8 pb-16 lg:pt-12 lg:pb-20"><div class="mt-0 mb-12 font-bold text-5xl sm:text-6xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl">---&gt;</div><h1 class="mb-24 flex flex-col col-span-6 col-start-1 text-5xl font-bold tracking-tighter leading-none xl:pe-36 sm:text-6xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl"> Discover your true power and learn how to use it </h1></section><section class="relative mx-4 py-12 border-t"><img src="'+k+'"></section>',2),B=e("span",{class:"font-bold"},"Picons",-1),q=e("span",{class:"italic"},"Principles + Icons",-1),E=e("sup",{class:"inline-block text-sm relative -top-3 start-1"},"ðŸ¡µ",-1),A={class:"grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-3"},C={class:"absolute text-5xl text-black opacity-0 transition-opacity duration-300 ease-in-out scale-90 group-hover:opacity-100 dark:text-white"},M={class:"relative -top-6 text-xl start-0.5"},N={class:"mx-4 pt-8 pb-16 lg:pt-12 lg:pb-20 grid grid-cols-1 gap-8 md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3 lg:gap-10 xl:gap-12 border-t"},R=e("div",{class:"relative pb-4 group group"},[e("h3",{class:"mb-6 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tighter lg:text-4xl xl:text-5xl"},"Knowledge"),e("div",{class:"relative my-6 aspect-square bg-black/5 dark:bg-white/5"},[e("span",{class:"absolute z-10 rounded-full w-1/2 h-1/2 top-[25%] left-[25%] bg-white mix-blend-difference"}),e("span",{class:"flex w-full h-full bg-black rounded-none scale-75 dark:bg-white"})]),e("p",{class:"text-base xl:text-lg"},' Knowledge base you can use and apply in your life.
