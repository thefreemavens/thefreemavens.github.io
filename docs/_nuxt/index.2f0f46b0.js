Thoughts lead to the manifestation of all things and events in creation. Thoughts create our state of existence and the quality of our experience here on Earth.

The universe is self-similar across all scales."},{id:3,title:"Vibration",slug:"vibration",subTitle:"Nothing is stationary.",desc:"Nothing rests, everything moves. At the most fundamental level, the universe and everything that comprises it, is pure vibratory energy manifesting itself in different ways. The universe has no solidity as such; the universe is holographic. Matter is merely energy in a state of vibration."},{id:4,title:"Polarity",slug:"polarity",subTitle:"Everything has its polar opposite.",desc:"Everything is dual, everything has poles.

At some level of reality, all things that seems contradictory may be reconciled."},{id:5,title:"Rhythm",slug:"rhythm",subTitle:"All is ebb and flow.",desc:"Everything flows; out and in, in and out.

Chance is but a name for law not recognised. There are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes law. There is no free will to ignore law without consequence; that is the limit of free will. This is why natural law is also sometimes referred to as consequentialism."},{id:7,title:"Gender",slug:"gender",subTitle:"Everything has its male and female properties.",desc:"Gender is in everything, everything has its masculine and feminine properties; gender manifests on all planes.

The lost principle is the dynamic of care; that which you actually care enough about to do, to spend your time on, to pay attention to, and to manifest into reality.
