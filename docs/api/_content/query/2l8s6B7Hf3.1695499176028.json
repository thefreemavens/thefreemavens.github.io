When we say no to those who claim to be our owners, those who\nclaim that they will decide which rights we have or do not have, only then do we stop\nexternalizing our power to anyone outside of ourselves and in doing so, reclaim all of our\nrights (all of our property). Sadly, very few people in our world have the knowledge, care, and\ncourage that is required to do this. That is why this powerful word is considered to be “lost.”\n“Know your Rights.” – The reason you have to know what the difference between right and\nwrong is, and therefore know what rights you have and which you do not have, is because\nthose who don’t know, won’t say no (to somebody who claims to be their owner)."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:1.lessons:38.the-lost-word.md","_source":"content","_file":"1.lessons/38.the-lost-word.md","_extension":"md"}
