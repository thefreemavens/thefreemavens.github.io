Which can be a difficult truth to learn, and to accept for a lot of people.\nFollowing orders means doing what you are told to do, without judging for yourself whether\nor not the action you are being ordered to carry out is right or wrong behaviour.\nIf an individual is following orders, that individual can impossibly be exercising conscience,\nbecause by definition, exercising conscience means that one is wilfully choosing for\nthemselves right action over wrong action.\nFollowing orders should never be seen as a virtue of any kind; if you are acting based solely\non what someone has told you to do, there is no morality found in that, whatsoever. There is\nno such thing as morally following orders, the two terms are contradictory.\nTherefore, “I was just following orders” is never a valid excuse or justification for immoral,\nharmful behaviour. This sorry attempt to give up personal responsibility should never be\naccepted as a valid excuse for such behaviour.\nThe order-follower tries to abdicate their personal responsibility for their actions and pretend\nthe blame lies with the order giver; which is an obvious lie (to themselves, mainly). They\ncould look you dead in the eye and say “I’m not responsible for that. I just did it; but I’m not\nthe person who’s responsible for it, because I was acting on orders from somebody else.”\nIt’s astonishing that they somehow truly seem to believe that statement can be regarded as\ntrue, in any way. Sadly, lots of people nowadays believe that there is legitimacy to this\nimmoral behaviour because a group of people calling themselves ‘government’ have\nsomehow been imbued and gifted with such “rights.”\nThe people in government believe they have rights that others don’t; but what’s even worse is\nthat the people who are actually affected by their immoral behaviour, they believe it too.\n“You assist an evil system most effectively by obeying its orders and decrees. An evil system\nnever deserves such allegiance. Allegiance to it means partaking of the evil. A good person\nwill resist an evil system with his or her whole soul.”\n– Mahatma Gandhi, pre-eminent leader of the Indian Independence Movement","cat":"Lesson","id":"34","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Order-followers are the people that keep the currently existent system of slavery in place; not\nthe ruling class, not the political “leaders” or “masters,” and not the so-called “elite.”\nThe people that keep the current slavery system in place, are the people who wilfully follow\norders.
