Understanding this information is not where this work ends; taking in this knowledge and understanding it is only the beginning. If you want to create change, action is required.\nPeople often say, ‘change happens in the heart’ or ‘change happens in the mind,’ which is true, but lastly it happens in the guts. If you have the “guts” to do something, you have developed the courage to do something. We must develop all three, heart, mind and guts; we must care enough to know, and then finally convert that knowledge into action.
