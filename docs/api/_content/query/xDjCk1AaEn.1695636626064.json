Just as it is not possible for an order-follower to truly be\nexercising conscience; it is also not possible for an order-follower to truly love themselves.\nThese states cannot exist simultaneously, for they are contradictory psychological conditions.\nSelf-loathing is created when an earlier trauma has been buried into the subconscious mind,\ninstead of being confronted, dealt with, and healed. Such trauma could form feelings of\ninadequacy; whether they are real, suggested, or simply imagined.\nA mind-set as such is a psychological prison, and yet, people suffering from self-loathing\nusually don’t seem to have any desire for true freedom; ‘they are in the cage, and they love\nbeing in the cage.’ The only kind of people that have no desire for real freedom, are people in\nthe psychological state of self-loathing, that do not love themselves.\nSelf-respect heals self-loathing; it is about introspection\n(observation or examination of one's own conscious\nthoughts and emotional state).
