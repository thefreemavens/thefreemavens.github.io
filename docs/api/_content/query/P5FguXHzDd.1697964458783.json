This dark age prison has no steel bars, chains, or locks. Instead, it is locked by disorientation and built on misinformation. Caught up in a plethora of conditioned reflexes and driven by the human ego, both warden and prisoner attempt meagrely to compete with God. All are intractably sceptical of what they do not understand. We are powerfully imprisoned in these dark ages simply by the terms in which we\nhave been conditioned to think.” – Richard Buckminster Fuller, American Inventor"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"post-apocalyptic-era"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Post Apocalyptic Era"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We are living in ‘Post-Apocalyptic’ times, in the literal sense of the word. The word ‘Apocalypse’ is derived from the Greek prefix ‘Apo- (απο)’ which means ‘Away from / Off / Removed from’ and the Greek verb ‘Calyptein (καλυπτειν)’ which means ‘to Cover / to Conceal,’ hence the word apocalypse literally means ‘to Reveal’ or ‘to Take out of hiding.’ Therefore, the apocalypse simply means the revealing of truth.

The word ‘Apology’ is made up of the Greek prefix ‘Apo- (απο)’ which means ‘Away from / Off / Removed from’ and the Greek noun ‘Logos (λόγος)’ which means ‘Word.’ Hence apology literally means ‘to Go away from the word’ (to take back something you said), or ‘to Give back the word.’ If a person says something they didn’t really mean, or something they want to retract, they apologise; they are “moving away from” what they have said."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Greek noun ‘Logos’ is derived from the Greek verb ‘Lego (λεγω)’ which means ‘to Speak / to Say’ (this is where the English word ‘Lexicon’ comes from).
