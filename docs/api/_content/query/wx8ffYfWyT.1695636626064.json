Government\nhas no ‘magic powers’ or ‘authority’ not possessed by private individuals. Let he who asserts\nthat government may do that which the individual may not assume the onus of proof and\ndemonstrate his contention.” – Chris Lyspooner, Ludwig von Mises Institute\nThe word ‘Government’ is derived from the Latin verb ‘Gubernare’ which means ‘to Control\n/ to Rule / to Direct.’ (just as was shown earlier with the etymological breakdown of the word\n‘Sovereign,’ there is no “V sound” in classical Latin. This can be readily seen in the name of\nthe ceremony for electing a governor; they are called ‘Gubernatorial elections.’) The second\npart of the word ‘Government’ is derived from the Latin noun ‘Mens’ which means ‘Mind.’\nTherefore, put together the word ‘Govern-ment’ etymologically means ‘Mind control.’"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The etymological origin of the English suffix ‘-ment’ is often debated, yet it is quite clear that\nthose who created the English language deliberately chose ‘Mens’ the Latin word for ‘Mind,’\nto mean ‘the State of-’ or ‘the Condition of-,’ in direct keeping with the first Hermetic\nprinciple; the principle of mentalism.
