This process starts by perceiving truth’s presence, acknowledging truth’s presence, accepting\nit for what it truly is, and then finally and most importantly, to do something with it. Understanding this information is not where this work ends; taking in this knowledge and understanding it is only the beginning. If you want to create change, action is required.\nPeople often say, ‘change happens in the heart’ or ‘change happens in the mind,’ which is true, but lastly it happens in the guts. If you have the “guts” to do something, you have developed the courage to do something. We must develop all three, heart, mind and guts; we must care enough to know, and then finally convert that knowledge into action. Because taking action is the most important step towards creating change in the physical realm."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ol","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Knowledge → 2.
