They often pause and ask themselves questions like: “Am I going to own\nmy body forever? I’m going to die someday, does that mean I don’t own it now?” This is a\ncomplete over-mystification of the concept. All sensible people recognise that they will die\nsomeday, and that their consciousness will then leave their bodies. Does that mean they don’t\nown their body right now? Your consciousness inhabits (lives- / exists inside) your body,\nwhich is one of the specific reasons you own your body, the other is that you are using your\nbody right now. – Specifically, because your conscious inhabits your body, and you are using\nit as the vehicle for the expression of your consciousness; your body is yours.\nContinuing on the topic of prohibition, it is the claim that a group of people who call\nthemselves ‘government’ have been given the “right” to prevent others from putting any given\nsubstance into their own bodies, and if those people refuse to comply with those terms, they\nwill be fined or imprisoned.
