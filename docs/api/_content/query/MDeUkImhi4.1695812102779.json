Because for most it won’t be an easy process; it involves a lot of deep introspective work. However, if we do this work, we can step out of the prisons we have imposed upon ourselves, by balancing the sacred feminine and sacred masculine forces within each one of us.

The world will look so drastically different if we go down that middle path to truth, order, and justice; the understanding, and applying of natural law.
