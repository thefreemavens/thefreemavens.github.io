This part of the brain also controls basic motor skills and respiration.\nIt is comprised of the brainstem and the cerebellum.

It does this by releasing neuropeptides into the bloodstream via\ndifferent glands that comprise the limbic system, for example: the pineal gland, the\nthalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary gland etc. It is the part of our brain which makes all\nhuman emotions possible. If this particular part of the brain would not function\nproperly, you would not be able to experience a normal range of human emotions.\nThis is partially what psychopathy is; with psychopaths this part of the brain does not\nfunction properly. Which could be due to some form of birth disorder, or from chronic\nconditions in somebody’s life which have “numbed” this particular part of the brain."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Neocortex is structurally the highest part of the brain, and evolutionary the newest\npart of the brain. The word ‘Neo’ derives from the Greek adjective ‘Néos (νέος)’\nwhich means ‘New.’ It’s where all the electrochemical activity that comprise our\n‘human modes of thought’ take place; that which we consider the things in thought\nthat make us human, and separate us from the animal kingdom.\nBy higher thought functions is meant, for example: logic, intuition, creativity etc.\nIt is essentially the outer layer of the brain’s grey matter. As far as evolutionary\ndevelopment of the human brain goes, it is the newest part of our brain structure."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The two hemispheres of the brain are bilaterally symmetrical, meaning they are able to be\ndivided into approximate mirrored images of each other along the midline.
