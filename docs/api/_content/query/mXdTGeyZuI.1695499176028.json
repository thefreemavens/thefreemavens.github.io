Ignorance, on the other hand, means not knowing something\neven though necessary information is present, because that information has been\nwilfully refused or disregarded.\n“If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what\nnever was and never will be.” – Thomas Jefferson, 3rd president of the U.S.A.\n“The only good is knowledge, and the only evil is ignorance.”\n– Socrates, Greek philosopher"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ol","props":{"start":3},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The positive aspect of the Internal Expression is ‘Sovereignty,’ or what is also\nreferred to as ‘Internal Monarchy’ (one ruler within). The word monarchy is made up\nof the prefix ‘Mon-’ derived from the Greek adverb ‘Mons (μόνα)’ which means ‘One\n/ Single / Alone’ and the Greek noun ‘Archon (αρχων)’ which means ‘Master / Lord /\nRuler.’ Therefore, monarchy means ‘One Ruler.’ As a state of consciousness,\nsovereignty means that one has unified the three aspects of their consciousness, in the\nway that there is no contradiction between one’s thoughts, emotions, and actions.\nThe word ‘Sovereign’ is derived from the Latin adverb ‘Super’ which means ‘Above /\nBeyond’ (In classical Latin the ‘V’ character represented a ‘U,’ hence the letter ‘W’ is\ncalled a ‘double U.’ The “V-sound” didn’t phonetically exist in classical Latin, instead\nthe ‘V’ was represented by the letters ‘P’ or ‘B’). The second half stems from the word\n‘Regnum’ which means ‘Reign / Rulership / (externally imposed) Control / Kingship.’\nThus, the word ‘Sovereign’ means: ‘One who is above the rulership or control of\nanother.’ Therefore, the word sovereign means ‘not a slave.’\nBeing sovereign means being a monarch (Mon-: ‘One’ / Archon: ‘Ruler’), a single\nruler who rules only the ‘kingdom of self.’ Sovereignty is a state of being in which one\ncontrols one’s own thoughts, emotions, and actions, and by bringing them into Unity /\nNon-Contradiction / Non-Duality, attains mastery of one’s own consciousness.\nSelf-Control = Self-Mastery = Self-Ownership\n24- The negative aspect of the internal expression is ‘Confusion,’ or what is also referred\nto as ‘Internal Anarchy’ (no ruler within). Confusion is the state of mind in which the\nbeing is ruled by fear and ignorance. Confusion can be seen as internal opposition, in\nsuch a way that one’s thoughts, emotions, and actions are in perpetual contradiction\nwith one another; the three are not in alignment. As we think is not how we truly feel,\nand is not how we act. There is complete contradiction and separation internally, when\nthere is no unity amongst these three aspects of our consciousness."}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The positive aspect of the External Expression is ‘Freedom,’ or what is also\nreferred to as ‘External Anarchy’ (no external ruler).
