example, let’s examine Taxation for what is really is, without euphemising.\nTaxation is the claim that a group of people who call themselves ‘government’ have been\ngiven or delegated the “right” to (forcibly) confiscate an arbitrarily chosen percentage of the\nproduct of another individual’s labour (a form of property), whether or not that person agrees\nto share that product voluntarily (coercion is involved). Taxation is enforced by the threat of\ntheft (seizing property that is rightfully a person’s possession), the threat of imprisonment\n(taking away the physical freedom of movement), or even the threat of violence (behaviour\nresulting in bodily harm) if those from whom the product is being seized attempt to resist the\nconfiscation. This practise is always “justified” by those who claim that such practises are\nnecessary and required to uphold the common good.","Lesson","23",{"type":174,"children":175,"toc":233},"root",[176,183,188,193,198,203,208,213,218,223,228],{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":179,"children":180},"element","p",{},[181],{"type":182,"value":170},"text",{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":184,"children":185},{},[186],{"type":182,"value":187},"The word ‘Justified’ etymologically derives from the Latin noun ‘Jus / Juris’ which mean\n‘Right / Law,’ and the Latin verb ‘Facere’ which means ‘to Create / to Make.’ Therefore, ‘to\nJustify’ etymologically means ‘to Create right / to Create law.’",{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":189,"children":190},{},[191],{"type":182,"value":192},"If we define the concept of slavery as: the involuntary confiscation of 100% of the product of\nlabour of another person, we can clearly see that there is no percentage to which we could\nlower this number (other than 0%) that would no longer constitute slavery.\nMany people try to justify this by saying this money is used for different services. However,\nwe aren’t able to refuse most of these “services.”",{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":194,"children":195},{},[196],{"type":182,"value":197},"Imagine, you have a computer at home; one day a computer technician knocks on your door\nand tells you: “I am now your computer technician, and you are not allowed to refuse my\nservices.” Immediately the right to choose (free will) has been taken away. Then he tells you\n“Whether you want or don’t want my technician services, I’m going to need $300,- every\nyear, I’ll come over every two months to collect my money. I do not care if you are happy with\nmy service or not, and if you refuse to pay me, I will take your computer.”\nDoes it seem like the computer is truly yours, if you are living under that kind of coercion? Or\ndoes it seem more like a violent criminal telling you: “I am going to steal your possessions if\nyou don’t give me what I tell you to.” That sounds more like a form of extortion or duress, and\nthat is what all forms of taxation fall under; duress.",{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":199,"children":200},{},[201],{"type":182,"value":202},"If we are being completely honest with ourselves, taxation is merely a euphemism for theft,\nviolence, and slavery; these are the three practises on which it is actually truly based. Since no\nindividual anywhere on Earth has the right to claim ownership of the product of another\nperson’s labour, such behaviour can never be delegated to a group of people, and called a\n“right.” Therefore, all forms of taxation are always wrong according to Natural Law.\nAnother important example of something to examine for what it actually truly is, is\nProhibition. Whether regarding drugs or junk-food, ingesting anything harmful into the body\nis strongly opposed, hopefully for obvious reasons; purification of the body is an important\npart of purification of the mind.",{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":204,"children":205},{},[206],{"type":182,"value":207},"It is crucial to recognise that anyone should be allowed to put anything inside their body,\nbecause they own their body. If an individual, for whatever reason, wants to ingest any given\nsubstance they always have the right to do so; because their body is their property.\nPeople easily tend to overthink the concept when confronted with the question whether their\nbody is theirs or not. They often pause and ask themselves questions like: “Am I going to own\nmy body forever? I’m going to die someday, does that mean I don’t own it now?” This is a\ncomplete over-mystification of the concept. All sensible people recognise that they will die\nsomeday, and that their consciousness will then leave their bodies. Does that mean they don’t\nown their body right now? Your consciousness inhabits (lives- / exists inside) your body,\nwhich is one of the specific reasons you own your body, the other is that you are using your\nbody right now. – Specifically, because your conscious inhabits your body, and you are using\nit as the vehicle for the expression of your consciousness; your body is yours.\nContinuing on the topic of prohibition, it is the claim that a group of people who call\nthemselves ‘government’ have been given the “right” to prevent others from putting any given\nsubstance into their own bodies, and if those people refuse to comply with those terms, they\nwill be fined or imprisoned. It should be self-evident that since an individual’s body is their\nown property, that individual always maintains the natural right to decide what will or will not\nbe put into their own property. In this instance, their own body.",{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":209,"children":210},{},[211],{"type":182,"value":212},"Imagine another person telling you that you aren’t allowed to put your jacket into your car, or\nthat you can’t put a certain piece of furniture inside your home. Why is it that most people\nwould not accept that, but do accept this concept regarding their own body? – Because people\ncan’t seem to separate the act of imbibing the substance, and the action that someone may\nsubsequently take, which are two different things. A person may have some drinks, and get\ndrunk if they wish to; but if that person goes out on the street afterwards and starts beating\nsomebody up for no reason, they obviously have no right to do that. However, an individual\nmaintains the right to go drinking, or use cocaine, or even inject heroine into their arm. They\nobviously aren’t good ideas, but every individual has the right to do so if they please; as long\nas their subsequent behaviour isn’t immoral and wrong. And if it is, they are still fully\naccountable for the actions they took, that’s what personal responsibility is.",{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":214,"children":215},{},[216],{"type":182,"value":217},"The two separate acts of a person having the right to put whatever they want into their own\nbody, and still being personally responsible for whatever he or she may do with their body\nafterwards, need to be clearly delineated, and separated from one another.",{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":219,"children":220},{},[221],{"type":182,"value":222},"Understanding this, we can easily see that the claim of “right” to dictate what will or will not\nbe put into the body of another person amounts to a claim of ownership upon the other\nperson’s body. Imagine somebody telling you that you aren’t allowed to eat carrots or drink\norange juice for example. The claim of ownership upon another person’s body is slavery.\nTherefore, prohibition is merely a euphemism for slavery, backed by violence, regardless of\nthe justifications made by those who claim such practises are necessary to uphold the\ncommon good. Since no individual anywhere on Earth has the right to claim the ownership of\nanother person’s body, such behaviour can never be delegated to a group, and called a right.\nTherefore, all forms of prohibition are always wrong according to Natural Law.",{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":224,"children":225},{},[226],{"type":182,"value":227},"Lastly, we will examine Licences and Permits, keep in mind to also visualise the same\nscenario with only two people as was mentioned before. In that sense, most people can readily\nsee that no single person, or group of people is able to legitimately make these claims towards\nanother person; regarding taxation, prohibition, licenses and permits. We have gotten to the\npoint where most people actually believe that certain groups of people have created rights for\nthemselves that other people don’t have. Licences and permits are claims that a group of\npeople who call themselves ‘government’ have been given the “right” to prevent other people\nfrom exercising specific behaviours, even if such behaviours cause no harm to others, or their\nproperty. Unless those people petition (definition of petition: “a formally drawn request, that\nis addressed to a person or group of persons in authority or power, soliciting some favour,\nright, mercy, or other benefit.”), or pay the government for permission (where the word\n‘permit’ is derived from) to be allowed to exercise those behaviours. This amounts to the\nclaim that rights are merely privileges that may be granted or taken away by government at\nany time, based upon the people in government’s preference or discretion.",{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":229,"children":230},{},[231],{"type":182,"value":232},"Remembering that the definition of a right is: ‘any action which does not cause harm to\nanother sentient being or their property.’ It can be readily seen that there is no such thing as\nthe “right” to stop someone from exercising a right, since rights cause no harm. The claim\nover the rights of another person is called slavery, regardless of the justification made by\nthose who claim such practises are necessary to uphold the common good. Since no individual\nanywhere on Earth has the right to claim the ownership of another person’s rights, such\nbehaviour can never be delegated to a group, and called a right.
