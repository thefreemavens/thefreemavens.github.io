This dark age prison has no steel bars, chains, or\nlocks. Instead, it is locked by disorientation and built on misinformation. Caught up in a\nplethora of conditioned reflexes and driven by the human ego, both warden and prisoner\nattempt meagrely to compete with God. All are intractably sceptical of what they do not\nunderstand. We are powerfully imprisoned in these dark ages simply by the terms in which we\nhave been conditioned to think.” – Richard Buckminster Fuller, American Inventor\nThe conditioning of our thoughts is what has kept us in this prison, and only now are some\npeople beginning to see the actual depth of it.\nWe are living in ‘Post-Apocalyptic’ times, in the literal sense of the word. The word\n‘Apocalypse’ is derived from the Greek prefix ‘Apo- (απο)’ which means ‘Away from / Off /\nRemoved from’ and the Greek verb ‘Calyptein (καλυπτειν)’ which means ‘to Cover / to\nConceal,’ hence the word apocalypse literally means ‘to Reveal’ or ‘to Take out of hiding.’\nTherefore, the apocalypse simply means the revealing of truth. The veil has already been\nlifted, and the truth about what has been, and still is going on here on Earth is already out\nthere, and available for most people to find.\nWe have to make, what has been called ‘The Cosmic Apology.’ The word ‘Apology’ is made\nup of the Greek prefix ‘Apo- (απο)’ which means ‘Away from / Off / Removed from’ and the\nGreek noun ‘Logos (λόγος)’ which means ‘Word.’ Hence apology literally means ‘to Go\naway from the word’ (to take back something you said), or ‘to Give back the word.’\nIf a person says something they didn’t really mean, or something they want to retract, they\napologise; they are “moving away from” what they have said.\nThe Greek noun ‘Logos’ is derived from the Greek verb ‘Lego (λεγω)’ which means ‘to\nSpeak / to Say’ (this is where the English word ‘Lexicon’ comes from). The Latin noun ‘Lex /\nLegis (Law)’ is also derived from this same Greek verb.\nGod, not man, is the author (authority) of law; the one who brought the law into existence.\nHumanity’s work is to learn to listen to God’s word, which is, Natural Law, spiritual law,\nmoral law, God’s law; and to align its behaviour to that law.\nHumanity must make this cosmic apology by giving the word (authorship of law) back to\nGod, and collectively aligning its behaviour with Natural Law. This is accomplished when we\nopen our minds and hearts to truth, and when we start saying the lost word ‘No’ to those who\nclaim to be our owners.\nThe very beginning of this guide started out with the chapter ‘Before we begin’; now we have\nbegun, and it’s up to you to take it further. What you will eventually do with this knowledge is\nentirely in your hands.","Lesson","42",{"type":174,"children":175,"toc":183},"root",[176],{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":179,"children":180},"element","p",{},[181],{"type":182,"value":170},"text",{"title":169,"searchDepth":184,"depth":184,"links":185},2,[],"markdown","content:1.lessons:42.at-the-crossroads.md","content","1.lessons/42.at-the-crossroads.md","md"]
