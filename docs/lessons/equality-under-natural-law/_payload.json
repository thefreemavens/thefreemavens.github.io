The morality and value of government,\nlike any other association of men, will be no greater and no less than the morality and value\nof the men comprising it.

Government\nhas no ‘magic powers’ or ‘authority’ not possessed by private individuals. Let he who asserts\nthat government may do that which the individual may not assume the onus of proof and\ndemonstrate his contention.” – Chris Lyspooner, Ludwig von Mises Institute\nThe word ‘Government’ is derived from the Latin verb ‘Gubernare’ which means ‘to Control\n/ to Rule / to Direct.’ (just as was shown earlier with the etymological breakdown of the word\n‘Sovereign,’ there is no “V sound” in classical Latin. This can be readily seen in the name of\nthe ceremony for electing a governor; they are called ‘Gubernatorial elections.’) The second\npart of the word ‘Government’ is derived from the Latin noun ‘Mens’ which means ‘Mind.’\nTherefore, put together the word ‘Govern-ment’ etymologically means ‘Mind control.’",{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":189,"children":190},{},[191],{"type":182,"value":192},"The etymological origin of the English suffix ‘-ment’ is often debated, yet it is quite clear that\nthose who created the English language deliberately chose ‘Mens’ the Latin word for ‘Mind,’\nto mean ‘the State of-’ or ‘the Condition of-,’ in direct keeping with the first Hermetic\nprinciple; the principle of mentalism. Which demonstrates that in order for any particular\nevent, circumstance, state or condition to exist in our current manifested reality (the plane of\neffects), it must first have existed in the mind (the plane of causality).",{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":194,"children":195},{},[196],{"type":182,"value":197},"Government is based on the illusory concept called ‘Authority.’ People that believe certain\nother people are authorities, means they believe that those individuals have rights that other\npeople do not.
