Unfortunately, this great change is not an automatic process, nor\nis it guaranteed to happen at all. Anybody who thinks that’s the case is very naïve, overly\npositive, and in some form of right-brain imbalance. Whether or not this shift will occur\nmainly relies on the human will to learn the truth and teach it to others. This involves\nenormous effort, dedication, and persistence. We cannot give up.\nThere is a saying in Alchemy that has been referred to as the ‘catchphrase of the alchemical\ntradition’ the saying goes: ‘Labore et constantia’ which means ‘Work and constancy.’\nConstant effort is going to be required to get this boulder up the mountain, and in the\ncondition in which humanity finds itself today, it will most likely go kicking and screaming.\nTeaching Natural Law to others is not an easy task, it usually isn’t fun, and we’re definitely not\ngoing to get it done in a day. Therefore, we are going to have to continually work hard on this\nmatter, or the quantum shift simply will not happen at all.","Lesson","40",{"type":174,"children":175,"toc":188},"root",[176,183],{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":179,"children":180},"element","p",{},[181],{"type":182,"value":170},"text",{"type":177,"tag":178,"props":184,"children":185},{},[186],{"type":182,"value":187},"A quantum shift has requirements:\nThe word quantum is derived from the (same) Latin noun ‘Quantum’ which means ‘Amount.’\nIn order to tip the scales of truth and justice back into balance, a certain amount of people\nactually need to be doing the great work of helping other people to receive this knowledge of\nNatural Law.
