However, if you wish not to get burned, there are certain requirements for obtaining\nthat condition. That means you can’t keep your hand on something that is extremely hot, or\nnatural law will take over and burn your hand.\nIn our current human condition it seems that a lot of people would say they do not want to be\nburned, yet simultaneously, they insist: “No, I want to put my hand on the burner while the\nrange is switched on, and NOT be burned!” But obviously, it doesn’t work that way.\nIf you don’t want to be burned, your hand can’t be kept there while the stove is on; if you\ndon’t want self-inflicted suffering and chaos in your life, you’ve got to align your behaviour\nto natural law. Which means you’ve got to know the objective difference between right and\nwrong behaviour, and through free will choice deliberately choose right action over wrong\naction. And only then, will you not get burnt.\nTrue freedom includes infinite possibility, which, by definition, includes the possibility of\nchaos. This possibility must be embraced without fear if we are to be truly free.\nFor real freedom to exist, we must accept that in the physical world there are risks, and there\ncould be dangers. There will always be the possibility of something unexpected happening,\nsomething going wrong, or someone getting hurt; but if you are living in that state of fear, you\nare living in a very low state of consciousness.\nFear ultimately leads to chaos. The fear of chaos itself can only get you more chaos, because\nit is based in fear (see ‘natural law expressions’ chart on page 22).",{"type":164,"tag":165,"props":176,"children":177},{},[178],{"type":169,"value":179},"The fear of the possibility of chaos is the fear of true freedom. This can also symbolically be\nseen as the “death” of the imagination.\nImagination is the powerful ability of the human mind to envision a different state or\ncondition than the one that is already manifested. Imagination must be present in order to\ncreate a different state of existence than the one currently being experienced. This is because,\naccording to the principle of mentalism, for a different state to manifest in the physical world\n(plane of effects), it must first exist within the mind (plane of causality).\nIf the imagination is stifled or destroyed, creating any positive change to our state of existence\nbecomes completely impossible.\nThrough their fear of the possibility of chaos (true freedom), most people advocate the\nlegitimacy and continuance of “authority” and government, and are therefore actually\nadvocating the legitimacy and continuance of violence and slavery.\nThose who believe that “authority” is necessary and that it must continue, have been duped\ninto believing that human slavery is necessary and must continue in order to prevent chaos.\nViolence and slavery cannot prevent chaos; violence and slavery are chaos.",{"title":156,"searchDepth":181,"depth":181,"links":182},2,[],"markdown","content:1.lessons:33.the-fear-of-chaos.md","content","1.lessons/33.the-fear-of-chaos.md","md"]
