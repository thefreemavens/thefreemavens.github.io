There are a few main steps to solving a problem, any problem at all. It doesn’t matter what the nature of the problem is.

1.  with. Fear-based denial must first be dealt with and conquered; because denial will only make the problem grow bigger.
2. Recognise that symptoms are merely effects of underlying causes. Instead of treating symptoms, you must make an accurate diagnosis of the cause(s) of the problem. (Diagnosis: from the Greek preposition ‘Dia- (δια)’ meaning ‘Through / By way of,’ and the Greek noun ‘Gnosis (γνωσις)’ which means ‘Knowledge.’ The term ‘Diagnosis’ etymologically means ‘By way of knowledge’) And in doing so, you will come to an understanding of what cause has put certain symptoms into effect.
3. Through the knowledge acquired via accurate diagnosis, take the required action(s) necessary to rectify the causal factors which led to the manifestation of the problem.
