title: Definition of Natural Law
---

Before we look at the definition of natural law, let’s look at the definition of the word
‘Definition’ – ‘An exact statement or description of the nature, scope, or meaning of a word,
concept, or object. / The degree of clarity of an object, image, or sound; for example, a high definition television.’ To make something (de)finite, as opposed to infinite.

The more accurate our definitions for words or concepts are, the better our clarity of meaning, and therefore, our understanding of those words or concepts will be. Therefore, ‘Definition’ means ‘Clarity of meaning’ when applying it to words and concepts.

Since most of this thesis is going to be about natural law from here on out, we must know the
definition of the concept:

<p class="emp">
<i>Natural</i>: Inherent / Having a basis in Nature, reality, and truth / Not made or caused by humankind.
</p>

<p class="emp">
<i>Law:</i> An existing condition which is both binding and immutable (cannot be changed).
</p>

Natural law is a testable hypothesis, meaning it is testable by scientific methodology:
Question → Gather information → Hypothesise → Observe → Analyse and test data →
Draw conclusion → Communicate your results. This works because natural law is not a religion or a belief system, but a science.

<p class="emp">
Working definition of natural law: Universal, non-man-made, binding and immutable
conditions that govern the consequences of behaviour for all intelligent beings. Natural law is a set of universal spiritual laws which act as the governing dynamics of consciousness.
