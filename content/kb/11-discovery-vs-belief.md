title: Discovery vs. Belief
---

<p class="emp">
Natural law is capable of being discovered, understood, and harmonized with; unlike religion,
which asks to believe, accept as is, and do without question.

You could best try to understand the way natural law works like you understand the law of
gravity, and therefore wouldn’t walk over the edge of a cliff. The law of gravity does not
require your belief to be in effect; and neither does natural law.

Belief is completely irrelevant when it comes to the existence and operation of all laws of
Nature, such as gravity, inertia, momentum, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. Similar
to such other phenomena of Nature, the workings of natural law don’t require belief in order
to be operational, discovered, and known.
