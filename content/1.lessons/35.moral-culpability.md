People everywhere say that they want certain conditions to be present for both themselves and their species as a whole, such as happiness, health, peace, freedom, etc. Which of course, are all great things to aspire to, and most people will say that they want these things. However, it feels as though they aren’t being completely honest with themselves, because when they are told that those aren’t automatic conditions that manifest themselves, and that there are specific requirements for us to obtain these conditions, they usually don’t want to hear about it. Also, people wouldn’t say they want these conditions if they were already omnipresent. People say they want something because they don’t already have it, whether it be partially, or in full.
