“The Dark Ages still reign over all of humanity, and the depth and persistence of this
domination are only now becoming clear. This dark age prison has no steel bars, chains, or
locks. Instead, it is locked by disorientation and built on misinformation. Caught up in a
plethora of conditioned reflexes and driven by the human ego, both warden and prisoner
attempt meagrely to compete with God. All are intractably sceptical of what they do not
understand. We are powerfully imprisoned in these dark ages simply by the terms in which we
have been conditioned to think.” – Richard Buckminster Fuller, American Inventor
The conditioning of our thoughts is what has kept us in this prison, and only now are some
people beginning to see the actual depth of it.
We are living in ‘Post-Apocalyptic’ times, in the literal sense of the word. The word
‘Apocalypse’ is derived from the Greek prefix ‘Apo- (απο)’ which means ‘Away from / Off /
Removed from’ and the Greek verb ‘Calyptein (καλυπτειν)’ which means ‘to Cover / to
Conceal,’ hence the word apocalypse literally means ‘to Reveal’ or ‘to Take out of hiding.’
Therefore, the apocalypse simply means the revealing of truth. The veil has already been
lifted, and the truth about what has been, and still is going on here on Earth is already out
there, and available for most people to find.
We have to make, what has been called ‘The Cosmic Apology.’ The word ‘Apology’ is made
up of the Greek prefix ‘Apo- (απο)’ which means ‘Away from / Off / Removed from’ and the
Greek noun ‘Logos (λόγος)’ which means ‘Word.’ Hence apology literally means ‘to Go
away from the word’ (to take back something you said), or ‘to Give back the word.’
If a person says something they didn’t really mean, or something they want to retract, they
apologise; they are “moving away from” what they have said.
The Greek noun ‘Logos’ is derived from the Greek verb ‘Lego (λεγω)’ which means ‘to
Speak / to Say’ (this is where the English word ‘Lexicon’ comes from). The Latin noun ‘Lex /
Legis (Law)’ is also derived from this same Greek verb.
God, not man, is the author (authority) of law; the one who brought the law into existence.
Humanity’s work is to learn to listen to God’s word, which is, Natural Law, spiritual law,
moral law, God’s law; and to align its behaviour to that law.
Humanity must make this cosmic apology by giving the word (authorship of law) back to
God, and collectively aligning its behaviour with Natural Law. This is accomplished when we
open our minds and hearts to truth, and when we start saying the lost word ‘No’ to those who
claim to be our owners.
The very beginning of this guide started out with the chapter ‘Before we begin’; now we have
begun, and it’s up to you to take it further. What you will eventually do with this knowledge is
entirely in your hands.
