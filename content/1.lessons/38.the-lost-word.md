The lost word is a concept in esoteric Freemasonry which represents a state of consciousness
that has been largely “lost” to the majority of people. In order to speak the lost word, a person
must work upon themselves in order to achieve a state of equilibrium (balance) between the
left and right brain hemispheres. In such a state of balanced consciousness, the individual has
come to know the self (microcosm), as well as the working operations of Natural Law
(macrocosm), and in doing so has come to understand the objective difference between right
and wrong behaviour. Or as they are referred to in Freemasonry, ‘Light (Knowledge)’ and
‘Darkness (Ignorance).’

In the balanced state of consciousness generated through the knowledge of Natural Law, a
person is finally able to speak the lost word, which is: ‘No.’ In Freemasonry it is considered to
be the word of all power. When we say no to those who claim to be our owners, those who
claim that they will decide which rights we have or do not have, only then do we stop
externalizing our power to anyone outside of ourselves and in doing so, reclaim all of our
rights (all of our property). Sadly, very few people in our world have the knowledge, care, and
courage that is required to do this. That is why this powerful word is considered to be “lost.”
“Know your Rights.” – The reason you have to know what the difference between right and
wrong is, and therefore know what rights you have and which you do not have, is because
those who don’t know, won’t say no (to somebody who claims to be their owner).
