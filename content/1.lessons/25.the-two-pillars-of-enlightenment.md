title: The two pillars of enlightenment
id: '25'
---

The first pillar of enlightenment is the ‘Sacred Feminine principle,’ also called the ‘Non-
Aggression principle.’ This principle states: do not engage in violence.
In other words, do not immorally initiate non-rightful use of physical force to coerce,
constrain, or compel the rightful behaviour, or free will choice of another sentient being.
The second pillar of enlightenment is the ‘Sacred Masculine principle,’ also called the ‘Self-
Defence principle.’ This principle states: sentient beings have the inherent right to use force to
defend themselves and others from violence conducted against them.
There is no such thing as an enlightened being that doesn’t fully grasp both of these
principles.
