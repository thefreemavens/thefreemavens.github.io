The main reason our species continues to experience a systematic and growing loss of
freedom is because we collectively do not deeply understand ownership, and we continue to
commit and condone theft.
To own something means that, regarding that thing, an individual maintains:
- Rightful possession (acquired without doing somebody else harm)
- Control of usage
- Maintaining personal responsibility
Natural law can essentially be reduced to a single spiritual law: don’t steal. That’s all.
We have to collectively understand that all rights are property rights. Stop taking the property
of other beings, and stop condoning the taking of property of other beings.
