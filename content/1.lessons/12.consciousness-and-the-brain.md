Consciousness: The ability of a being to recognise patterns and meaning with respect to events taking place; both within oneself, and in the realm in which the being exists and
operates. In other words, the ability to accurately perceive truth; that which has happened, and that which is happening at the present moment.

Expressions of Consciousness: The abilities we have, to make ourselves known to any other
being around us. These expressions are:
- Thoughts: Creative (neutral) force ♀+♂
- Emotions: Internal expression ♀
- Actions: Result of thought and emotion being expressed into the physical realm ♂

Like in almost all major religious traditions, this represents the ‘Holy Trinity’:
The father creator (thoughts), and the sacred feminine figure (emotions), which the father
figure impregnates or inseminates in some way. From that offspring a male child is born, always. The birth of this male child symbolises that the ‘saviour’ of humanity will be action; faith alone will not be enough.

Even in modern Christianity, in their own exoteric scriptures, there is only one prescription
that the Christ-figure gives to the people when asked about freedom: “You shall know the
truth, and the truth shall set you free.” (John 8:32)
