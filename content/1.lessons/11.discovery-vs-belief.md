<span class="desc">There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what is not to true; the other is to refuse to accept what is true.</span>

## Natural Law Vs. Religion
Natural law is capable of being discovered, understood, and harmonized with; unlike religion, which asks to believe, accept as is, and do without question.

## Belief is Irrelevant 
You could best try to understand the way Natural Law works like you understand the law of gravity, and therefore wouldn’t walk over the edge of a cliff. The Law of Gravity does not require your belief to be in effect; and neither does Natural Law.

Belief is completely irrelevant when it comes to the existence and operation of all laws of Nature, such as Gravity, Inertia, Momentum, Thermodynamics, and Electromagnetism. Similar to such other phenomena of Nature, the workings of Natural Law don’t require belief in order to be operational, discovered, and known.
