Most people don’t seem to think of conscience as knowledge, while that is exactly what it
truly is. It isn’t behaviour, it isn’t action; it’s knowledge.
The word ‘Conscience’ is derived from the Latin prefix ‘Con-’ which means ‘Together /
With’ and the Latin verb ‘Scire’ which means ‘to Know / to Understand.’ Those two words
combined mean ‘to Know together.’ Therefore, conscience is common sense, quite literally.
All of us together must come to an understanding of the definitive knowledge of the objective
difference between right and wrong behaviour according to natural law.
Exercise of Conscience (Action):
The exercise of conscience is the free will choice of right action over wrong action; once the
definitive knowledge of the objective difference between right and wrong according to natural
law has been acquired and integrated into the being.
We must acquire that knowledge first, come to an understanding of it, and finally we act
either in accordance with it, or in disharmony with it. If we act in accordance with it, that is
called the exercise of conscience.
