Education is the only solution, knowledge is the solution; and the propagation of that
knowledge is ‘Education,’ which means ‘to Lead out from.’ – The Latin verb ‘Educere’
means ‘to Take- / to Draw- / to Lead out from.’ Leading a person out of darkness (ignorance)
is what a real teacher does. Rather than “pushing” a person out of that darkness, the teacher
will go first and show that person the way, and if he or she feels it is the accurate path, that
person can follow the same discovery process. However, it must be a repeatable process; as
was mentioned earlier, Natural Law isn’t a religion or a belief system, it is a science.
