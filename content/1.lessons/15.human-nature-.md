Human nature is neither inherently good, nor bad. Instead, we should consider the operating conditions, and the environment in which human beings exist, that influence their behaviour to a great extent; thus, creating the current human condition.

What is the nature of a computer? – To compute information; which is nor good, nor bad.

 Human nature is to take in information, process it, and output in the form of behaviour. Much like a computer, human beings are programmable.

Similar to a computer, if a human has a bad "file-system format" (conditions during a child's formative ears), a bad “operating system” (culture / environment), and bad “software programs” (erroneous, rigid, and dogmatic beliefs), their “output” (behaviour) onto the “screen” (life) will also be bad. Therefore, these people will contribute to deteriorating conditions on a mass scale, for themselves, and all other beings around them.

The behaviour of any person will largely depend upon his or her programming; the quality of the information being taken in by them, which enables them to process and create efficiently.
Garbage in → Garbage out / Quality in → Quality out

**Knowledge (or lack thereof):**
Available information – This constitutes potential knowledge that may be generated,
processed, understood, and acted upon by individuals.

**Understanding (or lack thereof):**
Decision-making process – These processes take place in the mind and are chosen by each
individual based upon available information.

**Wisdom (or lack thereof):**  
Human behaviour – Each individual’s behaviour is based upon the quality of their decision-
making processes. Which are based upon the quality of their available information.

Wisdom is not the same as knowledge or understanding.

Wisdom is either action, or inaction, always. It is knowledge and understanding which has
been applied. “Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit, wisdom is not putting it in a fruit
salad.” – Miles Kington, English journalist

**Generated Result (order or chaos):**
Manifested reality – The quality of the condition which manifests in any society is based upon
