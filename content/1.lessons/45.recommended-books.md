Natural law is a set of universal, objective, eternal, non-man-made, binding and immutable
conditions which govern the consequences of behaviours of beings with the capacity for
understanding the difference between harmful and non-harmful actions.

The understanding of Natural Law is centred upon bringing one’s own conscience into
alignment with objective morality. This means definitively knowing which behaviours are
rights; because they do not cause harm to other sentient beings, and which behaviours are
wrongs because they do cause harm to other sentient beings.

Living in harmony with Natural Law means exercising conscience, and wilfully choosing
morally right behaviour over morally wrong behaviour, once the difference between the two
is clearly understood.

When people begin to live in harmony with Natural Law in the aggregate, and are therefore
moral, they become and remain free. When people live in opposition to Natural Law, and are
therefore immoral, they become and remain enslaved.

If you want to come to a proper understanding of what Natural Law is exactly, and how it
works in the world around you. If you wonder how it came to be that relatively small groups
of people calling themselves governments control the lives of billions of people worldwide.
If you want to definitively know the difference between right and wrong behaviour, and make
a positive change in your own life and the lives of the people around you, this will be of
interest to you.
