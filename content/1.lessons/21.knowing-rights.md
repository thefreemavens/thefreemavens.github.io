Rights are most easily understood when they are considered through ‘Apophatic Inquiry.’ This process helps us to understand what a right actually is, by understanding which actions are not rights because they cause harm to other sentient beings.

The word ‘Apophasis’ is derived from the Greek noun ‘Apophanai (απόφασις)’ which means ‘to Speak off.’ This is a method of logical, deductive reasoning, that is employed when given a limited set of possibilities, in which we gain knowledge about something by excluding the known negatives, or by setting the logical inconsistencies to the side. In other words, describing what something is, by explaining what it is not.
