The law of freedom states: freedom and morality are directly proportional.
As morality increases, freedom increases.
As morality declines, freedom declines.
Another way of stating this law would be to say that the presence of truth and morality in the
lives of people in any given society, is inversely proportional to the presence of tyranny and
slavery in that society. The more knowledge of truth and morality there is, the less tyranny
and slavery there will be within that society.
True freedom can never exist in a society that embraces moral relativism, the idea that there is
no inherent and objective difference between right and wrong, thinking that humanity may
arbitrarily “create” or “decide” right and wrong for themselves.
