title: Occult Knowledge
---


This knowledge is ‘Occulted,’ meaning it is ‘Hidden.’ Derived from the Latin adjective ‘Occultus’ which means ‘Concealed / Hidden from sight,’ which is in turn derived from the Latin verb ‘Occultare’ which means ‘to Keep secret / to Conceal.’ Just like in English, the word ‘Ocular’ means ‘Related to the eye / Related to sight,’ which is derived from the Latin noun ‘Oculus’ meaning ‘Eye.’ Occult knowledge is certain information that has been ‘hidden from sight’ for a specific reason.

Occult knowledge constitutes both the knowledge of human consciousness and how it operates, and the knowledge of natural law, the unseen universal spiritual laws which govern the consequences of human behaviour.

In the ancient mystery traditions and occult schools, these concepts are known as the two ‘Arcana’ which translates to ‘Secret’ in both Latin and Greek (‘Arcanum (μυστικό)’ in Greek)

The Lesser (Minor) Arcana: Hidden knowledge of the microcosm. – Deals with individual units of consciousness; the human psyche.

The Greater (Major) Arcana: Hidden knowledge of the macrocosm – Understanding of the
large (universal) laws of Nature that govern the macrocosm. → Natural Law,
