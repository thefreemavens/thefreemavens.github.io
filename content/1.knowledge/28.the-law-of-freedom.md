<span class="desc">The law of freedom states: <b class="font-bold underline">Freedom and Morality are directly proportional</b>.</span>

::mono
As morality increases, freedom increases. As morality declines, freedom declines.

## Inverse Proportions
Another way of stating this law would be to say that the presence of truth and morality in the lives of people in any given society, is inversely proportional to the presence of tyranny and slavery in that society. The more knowledge of truth and morality there is, the less tyranny and slavery there will be within that society.

## True Freedom
True freedom can never exist in a society that embraces Moral Relativism, the idea that there is no inherent and objective difference between right and wrong, thinking that humanity may arbitrarily “create” or “decide” right and wrong for themselves.
