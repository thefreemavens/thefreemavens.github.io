<span class="desc">Most people don’t seem to think of conscience as knowledge, while that is exactly what it truly is. It isn’t behaviour, it isn’t action; <b class="font-bold underline">it’s knowledge</b>.</span>

Conscience is common sense, quite literally. All of us together must come to an understanding of the definitive knowledge of the objective difference between right and wrong behaviour according to Natural Law.

## Exercise of Conscience (Action)
The exercise of conscience is the free will choice of right action over wrong action; once the definitive knowledge of the objective difference between right and wrong according to Natural Law has been acquired and integrated into the being. We must acquire that knowledge first, come to an understanding of it, and finally we act either in accordance with it, or in disharmony with it. If we act in accordance with it, that is called the exercise of conscience.
