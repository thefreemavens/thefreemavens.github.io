Derived from the Latin adjective *__Occultus__* which means "concealed, hidden from sight", which is in turn derived from the Latin verb *__Occultare__* which means "to keep secret, to conceal." Just like in English, the word *__Ocular__* means "related to the eye, related to sight", which is derived from the Latin noun *__Oculus__* meaning "Eye".
