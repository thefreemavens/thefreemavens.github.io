<span class="desc"><b class="font-bold underline">Chaos shouldn’t be viewed as something to be feared</b>, it should rather be viewed as a teacher. Definitely a harsh teacher, but a teacher nonetheless. It teaches us through the apophatic process, what not to do. </span>

## Do Not Burn Yourself

What you see pictured above is obviously a bad idea and you probably shouldn’t do that; if your desire is not to burn your hand up to the point of blistering and your skin coming off. But if you don’t care about that happening, then by all means, keep your hand right on that burner. However, if you wish not to get burned, there are certain requirements for obtaining that condition. That means you can’t keep your hand on something that is extremely hot, or Natural Law will take over and burn your hand.

In our current human condition it seems that a lot of people would say they do not want to be burned, yet simultaneously, they insist: “No, I want to put my hand on the burner while the range is switched on, and NOT be burned!” But obviously, it doesn’t work that way.

If you don’t want to be burned, your hand can’t be kept there while the stove is on; if you don’t want self-inflicted suffering and chaos in your life, you’ve got to align your behaviour to Natural Law. Which means you’ve got to know the objective difference between right and wrong behaviour, and through free will choice deliberately choose right action over wrong action. And only then, will you not get burnt.

True freedom includes infinite possibility, which, by definition, includes the possibility of chaos. This possibility must be embraced without fear if we are to be truly free.

## The Fear of True Freedom

For real freedom to exist, we must accept that in the physical world there are risks, and there could be dangers. There will always be the possibility of something unexpected happening, something going wrong, or someone getting hurt; but if you are living in that state of fear, you are living in a very low state of consciousness.

Fear ultimately leads to chaos. The fear of chaos itself can only get you more chaos, because it is based in fear (see ‘Natural Law expressions’ chart). The fear of the possibility of chaos is the fear of true freedom. This can also symbolically be seen as the “death” of the imagination.

## Imagination
Imagination is the powerful ability of the human mind to envision a different state or condition than the one that is already manifested. Imagination must be present in order to create a different state of existence than the one currently being experienced. This is because, according to the principle of mentalism, for a different state to manifest in the physical world (plane of effects), it must first exist within the mind (plane of causality).

If the imagination is stifled or destroyed, creating any positive change to our state of existence becomes completely impossible.

Through their fear of the possibility of chaos (true freedom), most people advocate the
legitimacy and continuance of “authority” and government, and are therefore actually
advocating the legitimacy and continuance of violence and slavery.

<span class="desc">Those who believe that “authority” is necessary and that it must continue, <b class="font-bold underline">have been duped into believing that human slavery is necessary</b> and must continue in order to prevent chaos.</span>

Violence and slavery cannot prevent chaos. Violence and slavery are chaos.
