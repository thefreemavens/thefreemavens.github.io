<span class="desc"><b class="font-bold underline">Time</b> and <b class="font-bold underline">Attention</b>, our two <b class="font-bold underline">Spiritual Currencies</b>. This analogy can be seen very readily in the sayings *'spending time'* and *'paying attention'*.

Whatever information or endeavours we put our time and attention toward, we end up getting
something in return for that investment. This return could come in the form of knowledge,
understanding, skills, or expertise. However, this only happens if we invest our spiritual
currencies wisely. We should seek to improve the quality of our attention by directing it
towards information that is capable of improving both our own lives, as well as the human
condition as a whole.

Such an effort would constitute a valuable investment of our time.
We should more frequently ask ourselves the questions:

**“What am I spending my time on?**

**What am I paying attention to?”**

And most importantly,

**“What kind of quality am I getting in return for these investments of my spiritual currencies?"**
