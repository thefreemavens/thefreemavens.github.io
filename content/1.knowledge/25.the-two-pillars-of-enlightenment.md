<span class="desc">There is no such thing as an <b class="font-bold underline">enlightened being</b> that doesn’t fully grasp both of the following principles.</span>

## The Sacred Feminine
The first pillar of enlightenment is the "Sacred Feminine principle", also called the **Non-Aggression Principle**. This principle states:

::mono
Do not engage in violence. In other words, do not immorally initiate non-rightful use of physical force to coerce, constrain, or compel the rightful behaviour, or free will choice of another sentient being.
::

## The Sacred Masculine
The second pillar of enlightenment is the "Sacred Masculine principle", also called the **Self-Defence Principle**. This principle states:

::mono
Sentient beings have the inherent right to use force to defend themselves and others from violence conducted against them.
